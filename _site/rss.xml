			<title>Investment Portfolio Dashboard (BigQuery + Looker)</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[	
 				
    		<p>1 min.</p>
				<div><p>I used to track my investments on <a href="https://www.junyichong.com/projects/investment-portfolio">spreadsheets</a>, but as my portfolio grew and I opened more brokerage accounts, maintaining these spreadsheets became increasingly cumbersome. To reduce the hassle and centralize all my investment data, I decided to build an investment portfolio dashboard using Looker and BigQuery. This dashboard now allows me to analyze my investment data from my first stock in 2020 to the latest updates, providing an intuitive way to visualize trends, evaluate asset allocation, and track cumulative performance.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h5 id="using-bigquery-for-data-analysis">Using BigQuery for Data Analysis</h5>

<p><a href="https://github.com/junyichong/investment-portfolio-bigquery">Github link</a></p>

<p>The foundation of this project was setting up BigQuery to handle all the data analysis. I started by gathering all my previous transaction data and historical stock price data into a Google Sheet, which acted as a central repository for my investment records. BigQuery was then configured to read and analyze this data, enabling me to perform complex calculations and generate meaningful insights.</p>

<p>Using SQL in BigQuery, I built data models to calculate essential metrics such as cumulative costs, realized and unrealized gains, and asset allocation percentages. By leveraging BigQuery’s ability to set up scheduled queries, I automated daily updates, ensuring that my analysis always reflected the latest information.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h5 id="visualizing-data-with-looker">Visualizing Data with Looker</h5>

<p>Once the data was ready, I used Looker to create an interactive and visually engaging dashboard (in dark mode of course). Even though the functionality is not as robust as Power BI, Looker’s flexibility allowed me to design dynamic charts and reports tailored to my needs. For instance, I created performance trendlines to track how my portfolio has performed against the S&amp;P 500 index, fees tracker to highlight the importance of less is more, and industry and regional breakdown to visualize diversification.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>This combination of BigQuery and Looker transformed the way I manage my investments. The dashboard not only saves time but also provides valuable insights that help me make more informed decisions.</p>

				<![CDATA[	
 				<h3>My Investment Portfolio</h3>
    		<p>3 min.</p>
				<div><h1 id="its-rewind-time-2023">It’s rewind time! 2023!</h1>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Well, 2023 was a solid year for my investments. My portfolio saw a 40.2% boost (33.8% before adjusting for foreign exchange), outpacing the S&amp;P500’s 24.8% but falling short of the QQQ’s crazy 54.8%.</p>

<p>Now, let’s break it down. Here’s the scoop on all my positions, sorted from the big hitters to the smaller players. And, of course, I’ll share my thoughts and comments.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="open-positions">Open Positions</h3>

<p><br /></p>

<h5 id="btc-614-155-of-portfolio">BTC <em>(+61.4%, 15.5% of portfolio)</em></h5>
<p>Held onto BTC, kept buying when it was low in 2022, and it totally paid off in 2023. Bitcoin almost tripled from the lows and is now the biggest chunk of my portfolio at 15.5%.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h5 id="goog-35-143-of-portfolio">GOOG <em>+35%, 14.3% of portfolio)</em></h5>
<p>The AI wave boosted Google’s performance, although a couple of hiccups in their AI releases cost them against Microsoft and OpenAI. This made Google the worst perfoming stock among the magnificent 7. Despite the slip-ups, I’m optimistic about Google riding the AI revolution wave. And let’s not forget, YouTube is still the best streaming service out there.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h5 id="kweb--199-112-of-portfolio">KWEB <em>(-19.9%, 11.2% of portfolio)</em></h5>
<p>Added a bit more of KWEB. Despite the short-term setback, my confidence in the long-term prospects of the Chinese internet and e-commerce sector remains unwavering, especially at the dirt cheap valuation now. Chinese stocks now make up approximately 28% of my portfolio.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h5 id="baba--428-114-of-portfolio">BABA <em>(-42.8%, 11.4% of portfolio)</em></h5>
<p>Added more to my Alibaba position but it just keeps dropping. While Alibaba’s performance has been far from stellar, the power of diversification proved its worth. The overall impact of Alibaba’s downturn was mitigated, demonstrating the resilience of a diversified investment strategy. Despite the management challenges, Alibaba is actively working to reward shareholders with initiatives such as buybacks, dividends and spinoffs.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h5 id="cspx-259-84-of-portfolio">CSPX <em>(+25.9%, 8.4% of portfolio)</em></h5>
<p>CSPX has been a solid performer, mirroring the 25% return of the index… Well, because it is the index. Its consistent performance underscores the effectiveness of index investing, making it a cornerstone of my portfolio.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h5 id="smh-648-79-of-portfolio">SMH <em>(+64.8%, 7.9% of portfolio)</em></h5>
<p>Admittedly, I trimmed some SMH at a less-than-ideal moment, but the AI sector has proven to be a gift that keeps on giving.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h5 id="pypl--65-52-of-portfolio">PYPL <em>(-6.5%, 5.2% of portfolio)</em></h5>
<p>PYPL is one of the two newcomers to my portfolio this year. With a PE of 12 and a substantial $5 billion buyback program in play, PayPal presents an attractive investment opportunity.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h5 id="amzn-829-51-of-portfolio">AMZN <em>(+82.9%, 5.1% of portfolio)</em></h5>
<p>Hitting the bottom just right has turned Amazon into the star player of my portfolio this year, soaring by an impressive 82.9%. Unfortunately this means that I was not able to build my full position, and ended up with only 5% of Amazon in my portfolio.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h5 id="dis--65-51-of-portfolio">DIS <em>(-6.5%, 5.1% of portfolio)</em></h5>
<p>The backdrop for this lackluster performance has been the ongoing writers and actors strike, putting a damper on Disney’s progress for the past year. I hold the belief that the worst for Disney is now behind us.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h5 id="xiaomi-492-45-of-portfolio">XIAOMI <em>(+49.2%, 4.5% of portfolio)</em></h5>
<p>This newcomer to my holdings has a special place as I have been a Xiaomi fan for years, and owning a slice of the business at this price feels like a steal. Beyond the smartphone market, I am particularly excited about Xiaomi’s venture into the electric vehicle (EV) business.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h5 id="eth-146-19-of-portfolio">ETH <em>(+14.6%, 1.9% of portfolio)</em></h5>
<p>I have not added to my position, instead, I was putting the resources into Bitcoin.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h5 id="aapl-604-11-of-portfolio">AAPL <em>(+60.4%, 1.1% of portfolio)</em></h5>
<p>Apple with its $3 trillion market cap does not seem rational to me, but I have decided to hold onto Apple as a benchmark, and since it is my first buy in the US market.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="closed-positions">Closed Positions</h3>

<p><br /></p>

<h5 id="meta-65">META <em>(+6.5%)</em></h5>
<p>Meta’s journey has been a rollercoaster. Held Meta all the way down, did not average down, sold too early and missed out on a $100 price increase. This is definitely my biggest lesson in 2023.</p>

<p><br />
<br /></p>

<h3 id="reflecting-on-2023">Reflecting on 2023</h3>

<p><br /></p>

<p>As I look back on my investment journey in 2023, I can confidently say that it has been a year of substantial growth. This year, I adopted a less-is-more philosophy in my buying and selling activities, and I managed to steer clear of FOMO and scams. Each investment, whether a success or a lesson, has contributed to my growth as an investor. The Meta experience, in particular, has taught me the value of patience, timing and having a strong conviction.</p>

<p>I look forward to the promise of a better 2024. The lessons learned and the resilience gained will undoubtedly shape a more informed and confident investor in the year ahead. May the new year bring new opportunities, continued growth, and success in every investment endeavor. Here’s to a prosperous and fulfilling 2024!</p>

			<title>Live Stream Chat Scraper and Analysis</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[	
 				
    		<p>1 min.</p>
				<div><p>In this project, I aimed to leverage the power of live stream chat to extract valuable insights and analytics. Utilizing the <a href="https://github.com/xenova/chat-downloader">chat-downloader</a> tool developed by xenova, I successfully retrieved chat data from popular live streaming platforms such as Twitch and YouTube. I conducted a comprehensive analysis of the chats from famous streamers like XQC, Disguised Toast, and Ludwig.</p>

<p>For instance, I focused on extracting all chat messages from the initial 10 minutes of each live stream, organizing them based on unique users, and calculating the average number of messages per chatter. To facilitate easy comparison of metrics across different streamers, I compiled the results into a .csv file.</p>

<p>Among the seven streamers I analyzed, XQC unsurprisingly garnered the highest number of chatters (5795) during the first 10 minutes. Interestingly, Fuslie stood out with the most dedicated fan base, as they averaged 3.3 messages per chatter! (Let’s go LESLER!)</p>

<p>By harnessing live stream chat data, this project shed light on audience engagement, fan loyalty, and popular streamers’ reach. It exemplifies the power of data analysis in uncovering valuable insights within the dynamic and interactive realm of live streaming.</p>

			<title>Pose Detection</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[	
 				
    		<p>1 min.</p>
				<div><p>In this project, I explored and compared two popular methods for pose detection: MediaPipe and MoveNet. Through this project, I aimed to analyze the strengths and limitations of each approach and gain insights into their performance in real-time pose estimation. This is initially a project I planned for my lab research but I ended up using a more accurate (and expensive) motion capture system instead of doing pose detection through videos.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h5 id="mediapipe">MediaPipe:</h5>

<p><a href="https://github.com/junyichong/pose-detection-mediapipe">Github link</a></p>

<p>Using MediaPipe, I implemented a pose detection system that leverages its robust and efficient framework. MediaPipe provides a comprehensive set of pre-trained models and pipelines for various computer vision tasks, including pose estimation. The MediaPipe-based solution offers accurate and reliable pose detection, making it suitable for a wide range of applications.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h5 id="movenet">MoveNet:</h5>

<p><a href="https://github.com/junyichong/pose-detection-movenet">Github link</a></p>

<p>Another method I examined is MoveNet, an advanced pose estimation model developed by Google Research. MoveNet utilizes deep learning techniques and lightweight architecture, enabling real-time pose tracking on resource-constrained devices. By implementing MoveNet, I explored its capabilities in delivering accurate and efficient pose estimation results.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Through this project, I conducted a comparative analysis of these two methods, examining factors such as accuracy, speed, and resource requirements. By understanding the trade-offs and unique features of each approach, I aimed to provide insights for selecting the most suitable pose detection method based on specific project requirements.</p>

<p>Overall, this project contributes to the field of computer vision by offering a comprehensive examination of pose detection techniques, showcasing the versatility and performance of MediaPipe and MoveNet in real-world scenarios.</p>

 				<h3>Sum Of Parts Value Of Amazon’s Businesses</h3>
    		<p>2 min.</p>
				<div><h6 id="note-this-is-an-article-i-wrote-and-presented-for-a-class-at-university"><em>(Note: This is an article I wrote and presented for a class at university.)</em></h6>

<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="1はじめに"><strong>1．はじめに</strong></h3>

<h5 id="11amazonについて">1.1．Amazonについて</h5>
<p>　AmazonというとWeb通販サイトだけを思い浮かべる人が多いかもしれないが，実はAmazonの事業範囲は通販だけではない．Amazonは1995年にジェフ・ベゾス(Jeff Bezos)により設立され，オンライン書店としてのサービスを開始し，現在ではプライムビデオや広告サービスやクラウドサービスなど事業は多角化し，FY2022 Q3の4半期決算報告により，Amazonの過去12か月の総収益は5022億ドルに達した．Amazonの収益構造は図1のようになっている [1]．目先の利益に捉われず積極的に投資を行うことで，他社サービスより市場シェアを獲得することに専念し，Amazonの利益率は長年1～7%だけである．</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-center" style="padding:10px 0px 10px">
    <img title="Amazon's revenue" class="w3-image" style="padding:0px 0px 10px" width="600" max-width="600" src="../assets/image/blog/amazon/revenue.png" alt="Amazon's revenue" />
    <p>図1　Amazonの収益構造</p>
</div>

<p>　Bloombergによると，Amazonはアメリカ時間2022年11月9日，時価総額が8790億ドルになり，時価総額が1兆ドル落ちた初めての株式公開企業になってしまった [2]．理由としては，インフレ率の上昇，金利の上昇，経済の悪化などが考えられる．しかし，株価は需要と供給のバランスによって日々変動しているので，実際に企業のビジネスモデルを分析し企業価値を求めないと，企業の株価が安いか高いか評価できない．</p>

<h5 id="12サムオブザパーツ分析について">1.2．サム・オブ・ザ・パーツ分析について</h5>
<p>　本稿では，Amazonの各部門のビジネスモデルを分析し，サム・オブ・ザ・パーツ(Sum of the Parts, SOTP)分析によってAmazonの企業価値を算出し，株価と比較することでAmazonに投資する価値があるかどうか評価していきたいと思う．
SOTP分析とは，複数の事業や資産を有する企業体の企業評価の手法であり，具体的には各事業や各資産毎に事業評価額を算出し，それらを積み上げて全体の企業評価を行う方法である．損をするリスクを最小限に抑えるため，保守的な仮定をしながら評価していきたいと思う．</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="2各部門の価値評価"><strong>2．各部門の価値評価</strong></h3>

<h5 id="21オンラインショッピング">2.1．オンラインショッピング</h5>
<p>　Marketplace Pulseの推計によると，2021年にAmazonの通販サイトで6000億ドル相当の商品が販売された [3]．Amazon自身による販売とマーケットプレイスによる販売を合わせた流通取引総額(Gross Merchandise Value, GMV)は，3年間で2倍になった．AmazonのオンラインストアによるGMVは前年比11%増の2,100億ドルに達し，サードパーティによるマーケットプレイスのGMVは前年比30%増の3,900億ドルに達した．</p>

<p>　Amazonの中で最も多くの売上を誇るのは，オンラインストア事業であり，売上約2215億ドルで全体の44.1%を占めている．オンラインのスーパーのような事業のため，世界最大のスーパーマーケットチェーンのWalmartを参考にすると，売上高が6000億ドルで，株価売上高倍率(Price to Sales Ratio, PSR)が長年0.4～0.7倍である [4]．0.5倍のPSRにすると，オンラインストアは2215億×0.5=1108億ドルの企業価値が計算できる．</p>

<p>　また，次いで多くの売上を上げているのが，サードパーティー・セリング・サービス(Third-party Seller Service)である．だれでもAmazonマーケットプレイスで開店し，商品の販売を行うことができ，Amazonはその販売手数料と送料から売上を得ている．その売上は約1117億ドルで，全体の22.2%を占めている．この中で300億ドルが配送料と推測され，残りの817億ドルが手数料が考えられる．手数料の中に販売プランと紹介料があり，Amazonのページによると，1つの商品につき0.99ドルまたは何ユニット販売しても月額39.99ドルの販売プランがあり，また商品が売れるごとに紹介料が発生する．金額は商品カテゴリによって異なるが，ほとんどの紹介料は約15%である [5]．Amazonは販売のプラットフォームだけ提供し，中国の大手Eコマース企業Alibabaの25%というかなり高い利益率が得られるとすれば [4]，15倍の株価収益率(PER)でサードパーティー・セリング・サービスの企業価値は817億×25%×15=3364億ドルである．</p>

<h5 id="22物流">2.2．物流</h5>
<p>　物流センターを中核としたAmazonの物流ネットワークは，EC事業のために投資されたアセットである．コスト効率の高い配送を実現するため，Amazonは20年もかけて1,000億ドル以上の資本投資で，フルフィルメントセンターと物流・輸送ネットワークを構築した． 2021年と2022年の2年間に，それぞれ180億ドルと80億ドルを設備投資に費やした [1]．</p>

<p>　2004年の時点では，Amazonのフルフィルメントセンターはアメリカ内に7カ所，世界各地に4カ所あったが，2021年末には，北米に253のフルフィルメントセンター，110の仕分けセンター，467の配送ステーションがあり，さらに世界各地に157のフルフィルメントセンター，58の仕分けセンター，588の配送ステーションを建設した．配送ネットワークは全世界で26万人以上のドライバーに拡大し，Amazon Airの貨物便は100機以上になった [1]．</p>

<p>　Pitney Bowesが発表されたParcel Shipping Index 2022によると，2021年にアメリカで配達された小包のうち，Amazon Logistics が22% (48億個)のパーセルを配達し，初めて大手宅配業者FedExの19%を上回った．また，Amazon Logisticsの売上高は2020年の183億ドルから10%増やし，219億ドルに成長した [6]．
しかし，100億ドル以上の投資額であっても，長期間にわたって減価償却(depreciation)によって100億ドルの資産と計算されないと考える．主競争相手のUPSとFedExの株価売上高倍率(PSR)を参考にすると，それぞれ1.4倍と0.5倍であり [4]，Amazon LogisticsのPSRをその中央値の1倍にすれば，アメリカ以外の売上高も加え，この物流ネットワークは少なくとも300億ドルの企業価値があると考える．</p>

<h5 id="23aws">2.3．AWS</h5>
<p>　AWSとはAmazon Web Servicesの略で，Amazonが提供している200以上の機能を提供しているクラウド・コンピューティング・プラットフォームである．</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>クラウドコンピューティングとは，共用の構成可能なコンピューティングリソース（ネットワーク，サーバー，ストレージ，アプリケーション，サービス）の集積に，どこからでも，簡便に，必要に応じて，ネットワーク経由でアクセスすることを可能とするモデルであり，最小限の利用手続きまたはサービスプロバイダとのやりとりで速やかに割当てられ提供されるものである [7]．</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>(Mell, P. and Grance, T., NIST によるクラウドコンピューティングの定義, NIST Special Publication, Vol.800, p.145, 2011.)</em></p>

<p>　簡単にいうと，個人や企業や政府機関がサーバー機器を購入し管理する必要がなく，クラウドサービスを使えばコンピューティング，ストレージ，データベース，セキュリティ対策などの機能を利用することができる．コストが低い，拡張性が高い，セキュリティが良いなどのメリットがある．</p>

<p>　Forrester Researchが発表した「Public Cloud Market Outlook, 2022 To 2026」によると，パブリッククラウド市場は2026年までに全世界で1兆ドルを超える巨大な規模になるとされている [8]．また，Synergy Research Groupの推計では，2022年第3四半期の世界クラウドインフラ市場におけるAWSの市場シェアは34%に達し， 2大競争相手であるMicrosoft AzureとGoogle Cloudの市場シェアの合計を上回っている [9]．</p>

<p>　AWSは，売上約765億ドルでAmazon全体の約15.2%だけ占めているが，営業利益率は32%で営業利益は248億ドルであり，実はAmazonの事業の中で最も収益性の高い部門である．AWSはクラウドという巨大な市場のリーダーとして，PERを20倍にしても高くないと判断し，AWSは248億×20=4960億ドルの企業価値を持つことが算出できる．</p>

<h5 id="24メディア">2.4．メディア</h5>
<p>　
　Amazonのサブスクリプションサービスは，Amazonプライム会員をはじめ， AWS以外のサブスクリプションサービスに関連するに関連する年会費および月額料金を含む．この部門の売上高は約342億ドルでAmazon全体の約6.1%しか占めていない．Amazonプライムに加入すると，送料無料や映像・音楽など様々なサービスを受けられ，アメリカでは月額14.99ドル，日本では月額500円で，非常にコストパフォーマンスに優れるサービスと言える．送料無料のためAmazonプライム会員になり，全てのサービスを利用している人がほとんどいないので，Amazonのメディアビジネスの企業価値を評価するのが難しいが，ここではPrime Video，ライブ配信サービス「Twitch」，Amazon Music，電子書籍サービス「Kindle」，オーディオブックサービス「Audible」を括ってAmazonのメディアビジネスとして分析していこうと思う．</p>

<p>　JustWatchが発表した2022年第3四半期のサブスクリプション・ビデオ・オン・デマンド(SVOD)市場シェア報告書を見ると，アメリカではNetflixのシェアは21%で，Amazon Prime Videoの19%，HBO Maxの15%，Disney+の15%と僅差で続く．また，Netflixの有料会員数は2億2309万人で，Prime Videoの2億人を上回った [10]．2018年以来Netflixの時価総額が一番低いときは2022年6月の750億ドルまで下落し，Prime Videoはその半分の価値だけあるとしたら375億ドルの事業が考えられる．</p>

<p>　Valuates Reportsのレポートによると，世界のライブストリーミング市場は2021年に383億ドルで， 2022年から2028年の間に16.14%の平均成長率(CAGR)で成長すると予測されている [11]．ゲーム配信プラットフォームの中，AmazonのTwitch はストリーミング市場をリードし，総視聴時間の約72%を占めている [12]．特にコロナ禍で世界各地がロックダウン中で，人々が家にいる時間が多くなり，Twitchの2021年の平均同時視聴者数は278万人で，2019年の126万人と比べて120%増加した [13]．</p>

<p>　MIDiA Researchが発表した2022年ミュージック・サブスクリプション・サービス市場シェア報告書によると，Spotifyはトップで，会員数が1億8780万人で30.5%のシェアを占めていて，Amazon Musicは4位で会員数が8220万人(13.3%)である [14]．また，電子書籍の世界市場規模は，2022年に199.5億ドル，2032年には321.9億ドルに達するとFuture Market Insightsが予測されている．オーディオブックの世界市場規模は2021年に42億ドルとなり，2022年から2030年にかけて26.4%のCAGRで拡大すると予測されている [15]．AmazonはKindleとAudibleによってこの2つの市場に早期参入することで，先発者優位を持ち，大きなシェアを占めることができると考える．</p>

<p>　ここでは，億万長者のウォーレン・バフェットが使ったことで世に広まった言葉「モート(moat)」について説明したいと思う．</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>モートとは，直訳すれば「お堀」といったような意味である．本来であれば外部からの敵の侵入や攻撃を防ぐための施設であり，ビジネスでこの用語が使われる際には，競合他社の侵略から自社を守ってくれるような参入障壁や競争優位性のことを示している [16]．</p>
</blockquote>

<p>　ストリーミングサービス，ライブ配信，電子書籍などのメディア分野でマーケットリーダーとして活躍しているが，Amazonのメディアビジネスの主な役割は，Amazonのエコシステムを支えるモートの一部と考えれば良いと思う．Amazonプライムに加入すると，オンラインショッピングから映画・音楽，電子決済まで様々なサービスを提供することによって，各部門が相互に補完しあいながら，顧客をAmazonのエコシステム内に留めている．Amazonプライムは月額500円で非常にコスパが良く，利益を出すわけがなくて，いつまで維持できるか分からないが，Amazon全体のモートを支えるためにメディアビジネスは永遠に赤字が続ける可能性もあり，企業価値評価が困難である．Prime Videoの375億ドルに他のメディア事業を加え，全体的に600億ドルの価値があるだろうと考える．</p>

<h5 id="25広告">2.5．広告</h5>

<p>　スポンサー広告，ディスプレイ広告，動画広告などのプログラムを通じて，販売者や出版社などに提供する広告サービスである．広告サービルのほとんどはAmazon.comで商品を検索するとき出てくるスポンサー広告であるが，Amazonデバイスやプライムビデオ・Twitchの広告も含まれている．Amazonは，お客様が買いたいものを検索するときに商品の広告を表示するので，Meta (Facebook)やGoogleのようにユーザーの個人情報やアクティビティからユーザーに対して有益な広告を予測する必要がなく，世界中で最も効果的な広告プラットフォームと言っても過言ではないと考える．Amazonの広告サービスの売上は約359億ドルで，YouTubeの299億ドルを上回った [17]．</p>

<p>　Googleの過去10年の利益率の中央値は22%で，PERは17倍と58倍の間であった．一方，Metaの利益率の中央値は30%で，最近5年間のPERは12倍と36倍の間であった [4]．TikTokにシェアを奪われることやメタバースへの投資など自社特有の問題によって，Metaの時価総額が大きく下げ，PERも史上一番低い数値の12倍に達した．Googleより低い20%の利益率，非常に低い12倍のPERを用いれば，Amazonの広告業務は359億×20%×12=862億ドルの企業価値が算定できる．</p>

<h5 id="26その他">2.6．その他</h5>

<p>　以上の6つの部門の他，売上高が189億ドルのフィジカルストアがあり，AIアシスタント「Alexa」を搭載したスピーカー「Amazon Echo」，テレビ向け映像出力デバイス「Fire TV Stick」などのハードウェアもある．</p>

<p>　また，Amazonは様々な領域の会社やスタートアップに投資している．例えば，Amazonは新興EVメーカーであるRivianの20%の株式を保有しており，共同で開発した配達用の電気トラックをアメリカで運行する予定である．また，2022年7月，Amazonはプライマリーケアを提供するOne Medical を 39 億ドルで買収することを発表し，ヘルスケア・医療領域への取り組みを進めている [18]．フードデリバリーGrubhubの株式2%を取得し，プライム会員向けに料理宅配サービスを追加した [19]．しかし，Amazonが投資した全ての企業の分析や価値評価を行うのは非常に時間がかかるので，今回では無視することにした．</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="3amazon全体の企業価値評価"><strong>3．Amazon全体の企業価値評価</strong></h3>

<div class="w3-container w3-center" style="padding:20px 0px 20px">

    <img title="Amazon's valuation" class="w3-image" width="500" max-width="500" src="../assets/image/blog/amazon/valuation.png" alt="Amazon's valuation" />
</div>

<p>　まとめると，Amazonの各部門の企業価値とその合計は表1に示す．単純に全てのパーツを足すと，1兆1194億ドルの企業価値が算出できた．Amazonの発行済み株式数は102億8000万株なので，この場合では約109ドルの株価になる．現時点(2023年1月11日)ではAmazonの株価が約90ドルであり，本稿の計算より17%低くて，つまり株の価格はその本質的価値と17%の差があることが分かる．</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="4おわりに"><strong>4．おわりに</strong></h3>

<p>　本稿では，「Amazonの株価が安い」という結論を下したが，決して「Amazonの株式を買うべき」という結論ではない．株価が安いといっても，あくまでも主観的な判断であり，絶対に損をしない保証がない．Amazonだけではなく，株式投資に興味がある方は必ず投資について十分に調査・検討し，よく理解してから自身で判断する必要がある．株式投資は，損したら誰も補償してくれないので，様々なリスクを正しく認識した上で，自分自身の判断と責任に基づいて行なわればならない．投資者として，必ず自分の投資目的や資産の状況などを勘案して，投資対象や投資金額を決めよう．</p>

				<![CDATA[	
 				<h3>My Investment Portfolio</h3>
    		<p>2 min.</p>
				<div><h1 id="ahhh-its-rewind-time-again">AHHH IT’S REWIND TIME… again</h1>

<p><br /></p>

<p>2022 was a bad year…again. I lost 20.5% of my portfolio this year, slightly worse than the -19.5% last year. Comparing to S&amp;P500 that lost 19.44% and QQQ that lost 32.58% last year, I didn’t do so bad after all, even though it was still bad.</p>

<p>Below are all my open position and closed positions, plus my thoughts and comments.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="open-positions">Open Positions</h3>

<p><br /></p>

<h5 id="kweb--14-15-of-portfolio">KWEB <em>(-14%, 15% of portfolio)</em></h5>
<p>Still holding onto my basket of Chinese internet stocks. Bought more at $27 thinking it was peak fear but it went as low as $17.</p>

<p>Don’t buy too much too fast. As the saying goes - “Markets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent.”</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h5 id="goog--15-14-of-portfolio">GOOG <em>(-15%, 14% of portfolio)</em></h5>
<p>Started buying at $120 and had my last buy at $85. I have my full position in Google already, hopefully it doesn’t drop like BABA.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h5 id="baba--48-11-of-portfolio">BABA <em>(-48%, 11% of portfolio)</em></h5>
<p>Another year as a BABA bagholder.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h5 id="cspx-breakeven-10-of-portfolio">CSPX <em>(breakeven, 10% of portfolio)</em></h5>
<p>S&amp;P500 ETF that I bought is one of the best performing assets in my portfolio… I guess that is the price of active stockpicking.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h5 id="smh--4-9-of-portfolio">SMH <em>(-4%, 9% of portfolio)</em></h5>
<p>Tried to understand the semiconductor industry but couldn’t figure out which company is better.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h5 id="btc--45-8-of-portfolio">BTC <em>(-45%, 8% of portfolio)</em></h5>
<p>The bubble did pop and I held it all the way down.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h5 id="amzn-1-4-of-portfolio">AMZN <em>(+1%, 4% of portfolio)</em></h5>
<p>Did my DCF and sum-of-parts analysis and figured that Amazon stock should be worth around $110. Bought at $83 and will buy more if it drops.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h5 id="dis--21-3-of-portfolio">DIS <em>(-21%, 3% of portfolio)</em></h5>
<p>Bought Disney for the strong brand even though the price is not exactly cheap.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h5 id="eth--45-2-of-portfolio">ETH <em>(-45%, 2% of portfolio)</em></h5>
<p>Still holding a small bag of ETH.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h5 id="meta--47-2-of-portfolio">META <em>(-47%, 2% of portfolio)</em></h5>
<p>Bought at $225 thinking I was being greedy when others were fearful… Then it dropped another 50%.</p>

<p>Even thought it’s really cheap at 10~15 PE, I didn’t catch the knife this time. Maybe because I don’t have strong enough conviction in META, or maybe because I have trauma from BABA. Not buying more might turn out to be a bad decision.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h5 id="aapl-9-1-of-portfolio">AAPL <em>(+9%, 1% of portfolio)</em></h5>
<p>Apple is still the strongest company of all companies.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="closed-positions">Closed Positions</h3>

<p><br /></p>

<h5 id="clov--90">CLOV <em>(-90%)</em></h5>
<p>Finally sold the stock on the last few trading days of the year. Just wanted to start 2023 with my biggest mistake gone, but in hindsight I might have sold the bottom.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h5 id="ipay--14">IPAY <em>(-14%)</em></h5>
<p>The company is in a growing industry with a P/E ratio of only 3. Sold after the Serba Dinamik saga as the company has the exact same problem - high receivables.</p>

<p>Sometimes a company has a low valuation for a reason.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h5 id="tenaga--11">TENAGA <em>(-11%)</em></h5>
<p>Sold the company to raise cash to put into US stocks. Probably almost broke even including the dividend I recieved in the 2 years of holding the stock.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h5 id="genting--1">GENTING <em>(-1%)</em></h5>
<p>Decided to have a more concentrated portfolio so I sold off all the smaller positions that won’t move the needle.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h5 id="twtr-1">TWTR <em>(+1%)</em></h5>
<p>Yep I FOMO’d again.</p>

<p>Bought the stock when I saw the news of Elon Musk buying, thinking I will not miss the Elon hype train again after Doge and Tesla. Sold after cooled off and realized it is just billionaire doing billionaire shit.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h5 id="genm-35">GENM <em>(+35%)</em></h5>
<p>Selling off all the smaller positions, with some nice gains this time.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h5 id="pbbank-46">PBBANK <em>(+46%)</em></h5>
<p>Sold when I found that it is trading at almost 2 times book value, which is very high for a bank and relatively high compared to its historical P/B. Turned out I sold almost at the top.</p>

<p><br /></p>

			<title>Keep AI in Mind When Choosing a Career</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[	
 				<h3>I wrote this before ChatGPT…</h3>
    		<p>6 min.</p>
				<div><p>You have probably seen in movies how the AI assistant JARVIS accomplishes any task given by Iron Man in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, or how the rogue AI Skynet tries to destroy the human species in the Terminator franchise. Even though the Artificial Intelligence or AI we have today is still in no way close to how it is portrayed in science fiction, the fact remains that it is already having an enormous impact on our daily lives.</p>

<p>In general, AI systems work by ingesting large amounts of training data, analyzing the data for correlations and patterns, and using these patterns to make predictions about future states.[1] Although we probably should not be too worried about the extreme case of AI enslaving humanity, we should never underestimate the capabilities of AI, and I believe it is important to always keep AI in mind when we are choosing a career. Today, we will take a look at three different ways AI might transform the job market, and how we can prepare ourselves for its ongoing evolution.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="ai-will-replace-some-jobs">AI Will Replace Some Jobs</h3>

<p>There is no surprise that AI will replace some jobs. With enough training data and computing power, AI can complete some tasks as well as, or even better than humans. Last month, a Google engineer made headlines after claiming the computer chatbot LaMDA (Language Model for Dialogue Applications) he was working on had become sentient and was thinking and reasoning like a human being.[2] Let’s take a moment to read this conversation together.</p>

<p><img src="../assets/image/blog/ai/lamda.png" alt="LaMDA" title="LaMDA" /></p>

<p>Even though many brushed him off as a crazy scientist, as there is no way we can prove whether an AI is sentient or not, there is no doubt that AI chatbots nowadays have become so good that sometimes it is hard to tell if we are talking to a human or an AI. Using the absurd amount of texts and videos on the internet as training data, Natural Language Processing (NLP) can only get better over time, and jobs in customer service and translation might be replaced by AI in the near future. Another example would be the autopilot system devised by Tesla using the data sourced from its fleet of nearly 1 million vehicles.[3] Tesla CEO Elon Musk is aiming to achieve full self-driving this year, and if this becomes true, truck drivers and taxi drivers might be put out of their jobs.</p>

<p>To avoid being replaced by AI, choose a career that requires creation, conceptualization, and interaction with empathy and compassion. AI-proof professions include psychiatrists, teachers, scientists, and fiction writers. Also, do not forget about CEOs and world leaders that are crucial to have leadership skills, teamwork-oriented skills, and organizational skills. If your job involves only repetitive boring tasks, AI can probably do it better, faster, and much more efficiently than you can, but it will cost way less. According to the McKinsey Global Institute, around 15% of the global workforce, or about 400 million workers, could be displaced by automation in the period 2016-2030, but there will be even higher growth in demand for work, 21% to 33% of the global workforce, or 555 million to 890 million jobs.[4]</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="ai-will-create-more-jobs">AI Will Create More Jobs</h3>

<p>An obvious example would be the need for more engineers and scientists to develop more advanced AI. Alphabet’s CEO Sundar Pichai announced that Google would operate as an “AI-first” company in 2017 [5], and he said that AI is one of the most profound technologies, as important or more important than fire and electricity.[6]</p>

<p>Today, the world’s largest tech companies are placing huge bets on AI to improve their operations to gain an advantage over their competitors, including web search (Google), content recommendations (Netflix), product recommendations (Amazon), targeted advertising (Meta), and autonomous vehicles (Tesla). According to LinkedIn, there are over 44,000 job openings for AI engineers in the US, from machine learning engineers to data scientists and software engineers.[7]</p>

<p>New technology has historically been a net job creator. There will always be changes in the old way of doing things, but a new employment source will at the same time be made available. When the internet was invented, no one could imagine its impact on our lives today, and how many new businesses and jobs could be created with its development. Like the internet, I believe AI will open the door to entirely new businesses and job opportunities. Open-minded leaders will see AI not as a threat but as an opportunity to take their company or even their country to a whole new level. We might not be able to predict what AI might bring us in the future, but we can always be updated on the development of AI and try to use the technology to our advantage.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="ai-can-complement-our-jobs">AI Can Complement Our Jobs</h3>

<p>AI can also complement and augment our jobs. According to a study by BMJ Quality &amp; Safety, in the US, approximately 5%, or 12 million adults receive an incorrect medical diagnosis every year, and it is estimated that about half of these errors could potentially be harmful.[8] AI that can read diagnostic scans with a high degree of accuracy will help doctors make better and faster diagnoses and identify suitable treatments, making the doctors’ work more efficient and less burdensome. I am not saying that AI doctors and robot surgeons can entirely replace humans any time soon, but if you are a doctor, incorporating AI into your workflow might be a good idea.</p>

<p><img src="../assets/image/blog/ai/dalle.png" alt="DallE" title="DallE" /></p>

<p>What do you think of these paintings? Would you be surprised if I told you they are not drawn by an artist? As a matter of fact, they are not even made by a human. This is the result when the AI called DALL·E 2 was given the prompt “A painting inspired by the Mona Lisa of a goat taking pictures with an iPad”. [9] DALL·E 2 learned to associate words and images from a database of hundreds of millions of pictures and it can create realistic images and art in a few seconds from a description given.[10]</p>

<p>This is one way AI can give us skills we never had before. In the future, with AI technologies like deep fake and simulation, people with or without an art-creating background are able to produce arts like paintings, animations, music, or maybe even movies with the help of AI and their imagination. There will be some AI tools out there that can complement our job, but it is up to us to look for them.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>Whether we like it or not, the advancement of AI technologies will not stop any time soon, and it will have a huge impact on our lives. We all want to have a job that aligns with our interests and skills, that can provide for ourselves and our families. If your dream is to become an AI engineer, good for you! But if it’s not, I hope this presentation reminds you of the importance to keep AI in mind when we are choosing a career, so that we can avoid being disrupted by AI, and seize the new opportunities presented by the new technology. By keeping an open mind to changes in the world, visionaries managed to use the new technologies to their advantage, from computers to the internet to smartphones, and build the most successful companies in the world.</p>

				<div><p>How much would you pay for two large pizzas? 5,000 yen? 10,000 yen?</p>

<h1 id="how-about-300-million">How about $300 million?</h1>

<p><br /></p>

<p>About 12 years ago, a Florida man Laszlo Hanyecz purchased a pair of Papa John’s pizzas using 10,000 Bitcoins, which equated to roughly $41 back in 2010. He didn’t get himself a bargain as the pizzas would have cost $25 had he paid in cash, but at least he and his family had a great evening, and hopefully some leftovers.</p>

<p>However, just nine months later, the deal seemed even worse when Bitcoin reached 1:1 with the US dollar making the two pizzas worth $10,000. Today, those 10,000 Bitcoins would be valued at around $300 million. This was the first commercial Bitcoin transaction, and it is for this reason that May 22nd is designated as Bitcoin Pizza Day (1). So, what is Bitcoin?</p>

<p>It seems like a simple question, but you will get a variety of answers. The anti-Bitcoin will say that Bitcoin is a hoax and has no real value as its price fell more than 60% from its peak (2), while the pro-Bitcoin will respond that if you live in a country like Turkey you lost 50% in a year regardless (3). The Bitcoin haters will tell you that it is a currency for criminals as $14 billion of cryptocurrencies were being used in crimes in 2021 (4), while the Bitcoin holders will argue that there must be way more crimes involving cash. The news will say that Bitcoin is the worst creation ever because it consumes more electricity than countries like UAE, Argentina and the Netherlands (5), while the Bitcoin blogs will show you the research that claims that the banking system uses more than double the energy of Bitcoin (6).</p>

<p>The truth is, no matter which side you are on, you can always find a piece of data that fits your narratives, and tell the story you want to tell. I am not here to convince you that Bitcoin is good or evil, or whether you should invest in Bitcoin or not. Instead, as an engineering student who loves learning new things and a small investor who has been dabbling in all sorts of investment vehicles, I am here to share some of my findings on Bitcoin, and why I think that Bitcoin is a better form of money than the currencies we are using today.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="what-makes-a-good-currency">What makes a good currency?</h3>

<p>Have you ever wondered why we use the Japanese Yen to pay for goods and services instead of using apples?</p>

<p>First of all, the Japanese Yen is the official currency issued by the Japanese government and we are in Japan right now, so everybody is using Yen. That’s obvious. We receive payments in Yen because we know that someone else will accept it as payment whenever we need to buy something. If someone tries to pay you with apples, you probably think that they are crazy. Next, we don’t use apples as money because eventually they’ll spoil, while the banknotes and coins are durable and can keep their value for a long time. It’s difficult to purchase something, say a candy, that is worth a fraction of an apple. In comparison, we can technically buy something that is as cheap as just 1 Yen. Of course, it’s also way easier to pay with cash than carrying bags of apples around. Finally, it’s scarce as no one can print more money freely (except for the government), but anyone with a backyard can always plant more apple trees and destroy the value of apples for everyone.</p>

<p>In short, I would say that a useful currency should have these five attributes: acceptability, durability, divisibility, portability and scarcity (8).</p>

</div>

<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="what-is-bitcoin-9">What is Bitcoin? (9)</h3>

<p>Now back to the question of what is Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency, or cryptocurrency, invented in 2008 by an unknown person or group by the name of Satoshi Nakamoto. “Decentralized” means that Bitcoin operates free of any central control or the oversight of banks or governments, and it can be sent from user to user on the Bitcoin network without the need for intermediaries, or middlemen. There is a public ledger that records all Bitcoin transactions and the copies are held on servers, also known as nodes, around the world. Every 10 minutes, new transactions will be updated on the ledger, and consensus on who owns how many Bitcoins is reached across these nodes rather than relying on a central source of trust like a bank.</p>

<p>Let’s say I send you 0.001 Bitcoin and regret it afterward. If I try to hack into your computer and delete the transaction on your ledger, it isn’t going to work, because all the other ledgers are saying a different thing. I won’t be getting back my money unless you send it back. This makes it practically impossible to alter the figures on the ledgers because you need to control the majority of all of the nodes to do so. The more the people that use Bitcoin, the more nodes there will be, and the harder it is for any party to tamper with the ledger.</p>

<p>This is the core concept of Bitcoin, a decentralized digital currency. I’m not going to bore you with the technicality of how Bitcoin works, with all the buzzwords like “cryptography”, “blockchain” and “mining”. You really don’t need to understand everything about Bitcoin in order to use it, like how most of us couldn’t describe how the internet works but still use it every single day. Instead, let’s take a look at some of the properties of Bitcoin to see how Bitcoin stands against other currencies in the world.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="the-properties-of-bitcoin">The properties of Bitcoin</h3>

<p><strong>First of all, is Bitcoin widely accepted?</strong> We can send any amount of Bitcoin to anyone in any country at any time, provided the person has a Bitcoin address. Unlike the traditional banking system, it doesn’t matter which country you are from, how old you are, or how much money you make, you can have a Bitcoin address with just a few clicks. Bitcoin does not discriminate. Here are some of the names you might have heard of that accept Bitcoin. You can pay for games and apps in the Windows and Xbox stores ever since 2014. Or you can donate to Wikipedia using Bitcoin. I am sure some of you have been to or at least heard of this huge electronics chain called Bic Camera. You can actually pay with Bitcoin there too! (12)</p>

<div class="w3-container" style="padding:0px 0px 10px">
    <img title="Bic Camera" class="w3-image w3-padding" width="300" max-width="400" src="../assets/image/blog/bitcoin/biccamera.jpg" alt="Bic Camera" />
</div>

<p>Another great example of the acceptability of Bitcoin can be seen when the Ukrainian government tweeted the pleas for donations in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies (13). To date, the two addresses have received donations worth more than $30 million (14) (15).</p>

<p><img src="../assets/image/blog/bitcoin/ukraine.png" alt="Ukraine" title="Ukraine" /></p>

<p>It’s especially convenient for people that need to make international transfers. With the bank I’m currently using in Japan, I’ll need to pay a transfer fee of 3,000 to 7,500 Yen, and wait for two to seven business days for the transfer to go through (10). Not to mention the money lost through their terrible conversion rate and the hassle to fill in all the required details. With Bitcoin, all I need is the recipient’s Bitcoin address, around $2 in fees and an hour at most.</p>

<p><strong>Bitcoin is also divisible.</strong> The smallest unit of Bitcoin is called Satoshi, which represents a hundred millionth of a Bitcoin. Obviously, it is named after Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin. Most currencies can only be divided into two decimal places like the US Dollar, or can’t be divided at all like the Japanese Yen.</p>

<p><strong>Is Bitcoin durable?</strong> Bitcoin is just lines of codes stored in thousands of computers, so of course it’s durable. In the case of a global internet shutdown, which is extremely unlikely, the computers will stop communicating with each other but the halt would not affect the content of the ledgers. Once the internet is back, the computers will verify the copies, like they always do.</p>

<p><strong>Is Bitcoin portable?</strong> Yes and no. No, you can’t carry a physical Bitcoin around. Yes, you can send or receive Bitcoin on your phone just like how you use a digital wallet, scan-and-pay. If you are comfortable doing cashless payments with apps like PayPay and LinePay, Bitcoin wouldn’t be a problem for you.</p>

<p><strong>How about the scarcity of Bitcoin?</strong> When Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin, he wrote in the source code that only 21 million Bitcoins will ever be produced. There are 19 million Bitcoins in existence now, and more will be created in a predetermined manner until the last one is created in 2140. This is arguably the biggest difference between Bitcoin and our traditional currencies. Currencies supplied by central governments do not have limits, which means governments are free to print more whenever they need. Look at this graph by the Federal Reserve (16) and you’ll realize how much the money supply had surged in the past two years. This is said to be one of the reasons why we are now seeing the highest inflation rate in the United States in 40 years (17).</p>

<div class="w3-container" style="padding:0px 0px 10px">
    <img title="M1" class="w3-image w3-padding" width="500" max-width="500" src="../assets/image/blog/bitcoin/m1.png" alt="M1" />
</div>

<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>So, I painted Bitcoin as the perfect currency, the future of finance, the magical coin that will make you filthy rich. Does that mean you should put all your money into Bitcoin and wait for the price to rise until you become a millionaire? It’s true that Bitcoin exhibits a lot of the traits a good currency should have. It’s widely accepted, durable, divisible, portable, and scarce.</p>

<p>However, there have been equal, if not more criticisms of Bitcoin, including the insane volatility of price, the long transaction time, the enormous energy consumption to maintain the network, the usage in criminal activities, and the crackdown by the governments, just to name a few. These are all legitimate concerns you should have if you decided that you want to own Bitcoin. I’ve done my research and only put in a small amount of money that I’m comfortable losing. I certainly don’t expect the price to increase 100-fold like how it did back then.</p>

<p>Lastly, I want to make it clear that this is not financial advice and you should always do your own due diligence before making any investment. Thank you for listening.</p>

			<title>The Risks of Investing in Chinese Stocks</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[	
 				
    		<p>5 min.</p>
				<div><p>This article lists all the risks of investing in Chinese stocks (that I can think of and read about), in both Hong Kong and the US stock market.</p>

<p>By the time I finished this writing, I have 30% of my portfolio in Chinese stocks, split 2:1 between $BABA and $KWEB.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4 id="real-estate-bubble">Real Estate Bubble</h4>

<p>The people in China have always been putting their life savings in the housing market, instead of the stock market like in the US. One of the reasons could be the Chinese tradition of everyone (especially guys) needing to have their own house, in order to start a family. Besides, it is said that the real estate prices can only go up, right? (2008 flashback)</p>

<p>This has made buying a house in China enormously expensive, with a house price-to-household income ratio of 19 in the biggest “tier-one” cities such as Beijing or Shanghai, 10 in tier-two and seven in tier-three cities. The average ratio in the UK is about 10 and in the US it is four.</p>

<p>The problem worsens as 20 of the top 30 property firms in China have breached at least one of three debt redlines set down by the Beijing government to rein in real estate speculation, with Evergrande making the headlines lately. The collapse of Evergrande — which employs 200,000 people and indirectly sustains 3 million jobs — might cause a serious chain reaction in the country, and make domestic and foreign investors lose billions.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4 id="variable-interest-entity-vie-structure">Variable Interest Entity (VIE) Structure</h4>

<p>Under Chinese law, foreign ownership in certain (most) Chinese industries is prohibited. So, a company that desires to raise capital overseas has to create a Cayman Islands listed shell company (no real business, no office, no employees), then create a complex web of legal agreements to give the shell company a claim on the profits and control of the assets. This is called the VIE structure.</p>

<p>Through this structure, investors only own shares of the shell company instead of the actual underlying Chinese company. Therefore, at its most extreme, China is completely within its legal right (even if it was illegal, would the CCP care?) to declare all these VIEs worthless, which would wipe out trillions of dollars from international shareholders invested in these VIE companies.</p>

<p>However, some companies, like $BABA have upsized their share repurchase program from $10 billion to $15 billion through 2022, which means they will be buying back the ‘fake shares’ like the rest of us.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4 id="policy-change">Policy Change</h4>
<p>A few months ago, Chinese regulators published reforms that will make private firms teaching the school curriculum ‘non-profit organization’, as Beijing aims to overhaul a sector it says has been “hijacked by capital.” The new regulations ban firms that teach school curriculums from making profits, raising capital, or going public. This should be a good thing for the young generation in China, who are being put under unimaginable pressure by their parents and teachers, to ace the Gao Kao exam.</p>

<p>China’s strict limits on how long minors can play online video games just got stricter. The rules released recently tightened restrictions to curb online game addiction among schoolchildren, which Chinese children and teenagers are barred from online gaming on school days, and limited to one hour a day on weekends and holiday evenings.</p>

<p>Let’s not forget the news where China suspended the $34 billion IPO of Ant Group, the largest FinTech company in China owned by $BABA, just two days before its planned listing, right after Jack Ma criticized the Chinese financial system.</p>

<p>The CCP has been asserting greater control over its private companies, particularly companies like $BABA and Tencent that have extensive data on over a billion Chinese citizens. They are the easy target if the crackdown by the CCP continues.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4 id="delisting-fear">Delisting Fear</h4>

<p>$DIDI, a $39 billion ride-hailing company in China, announced that it would delist its shares from the New York Stock Exchange due to concerns about data security. Just six months ago, $DIDI raised billions of dollars from American pension funds and international investors in their initial public offering, ignoring objections from the CCP. This makes investors fear that other Chinese companies in the US would be delisted too. This year, it is estimated that nearly 250 Chinese firms had a total market cap of $2.1 trillion (which is declining every day) trading on American exchanges. It would cause chaos if some of the big names got delisted.</p>

<p>Under the latest regulation, auditing firms have to be subject to inspection by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) for all public securities in the US. While more than 50 jurisdictions have worked with the PCAOB to allow the required inspections, two historically have not: China and Hong Kong. If governmental authorities don’t allow the auditors of foreign companies to open their papers to PCAOB inspection for three consecutive years, the companies could be prohibited from trading in the US.</p>

<p>Even though the ADR shares trading in the US is fully convertible to ordinary shares in Hong Kong in the case of delisting, a crash in share price is most certainly inevitable.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4 id="common-prosperity">Common Prosperity</h4>

<p>China seeks a private sector more in line with the CCP’s common prosperity goal — aims that Wall Street investors most likely can’t help with. $BABA pledged to ‘donate’ 100 billion yuan ($15.5 billion) to help narrow the nation’s wealth gap by 2025, while Tencent said they would invest 50 billion yuan. This is definitely bad for the investors as the money could be distributed as dividends, used to do share buyback, or invested in the business itself.</p>

<p>As a company that generated $29 billion of free cash flow in 2021, the donation probably won’t hurt $BABA too much. However, who knows if they will be asked for another 100 billion after 2025. On the bright side, the capital spent will be used to help lift millions of Chinese from poverty, which in the long run will benefit the economy and all the companies in China.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4 id="chinas-growth-slowdown">China’s Growth Slowdown</h4>

<p>The world’s second-largest economy grew by a weaker-than-expected 4.9% over a year ago in the three months ending in September, down from the previous quarter’s 7.9%. Factory output, retail sales and investment in construction and other fixed assets all weakened.</p>

 				<h3>My Investment Portfolio</h3>
    		<p>5 min.</p>
				<div><h1 id="ahhh-its-rewind-time">AHHH IT’S REWIND TIME</h1>

<p><br /></p>

<p>2021 is definitely a bad year. I lost 19.5% of my portfolio this year, with only cryptocurrencies in the green. If I had invested all my money in the S&amp;P500 in January, I would have made 26.9% this year, which means I would have 50% more money than I have now.</p>

<p>I went through all my winners and losers, and write down all the lessons and mistakes I have learnt, hopefully 19.5% is the biggest loss I will ever have. One thing I am most grateful for is that I made all these blunders when I am 22, instead of 44 when I should have a much higher net worth and a lower risk tolerance.</p>

<p>Since I didn’t do a recap for 2020, below are all the things the market taught me from September 2020 till the end of 2021.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="open-positions">Open Positions</h3>

<p><br /></p>

<h5 id="ethereum-59-6-of-portfolio">Ethereum <em>(+59%, 6% of portfolio)</em></h5>

<p>I had my biggest gain of 2021 in a cryptocurrency, who would have thought. I wouldn’t be surprised if the NFT bubble pops and crashes ETH.
Crypto is still a non-productive asset.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h5 id="apple-48-15-of-portfolio">Apple <em>(+48%, 1.5% of portfolio)</em></h5>
<p>My biggest winner in 2021 - a single share of $AAPL.</p>

<p>The strong get stronger.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h5 id="public-bank-36-4-of-portfolio">Public Bank <em>(+36%, 4% of portfolio)</em></h5>
<p>The first stock I ever bought. Should’ve taken the advantage of the spike after the bonus issue where the price was at RM4.70 for no reason. I knew the stock was overpriced but didn’t sell because I wanted to hold on to my first stock.</p>

<p>Bonus issue or stock split doesn’t make a difference in the value of the business.
Don’t be overly attached to a stock.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h5 id="bitcoin-21-8-of-portfolio">Bitcoin <em>(+21%, 8% of portfolio)</em></h5>
<p>Don’t try to time the market.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h5 id="tenaga-nasional-05-12-of-portfolio">Tenaga Nasional <em>(+0.5%, 12% of portfolio)</em></h5>
<p>I bought the stock because of the monopoly by Tenaga. Got a few rounds of dividends but they couldn’t make up the drop in share price. At one point I was over-exposed to the stock but now sold off 25%.</p>

<p>Don’t buy a company that is not growing.
Check for special dividend and dividend payout ratio.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h5 id="alibaba--30-15-of-portfolio">Alibaba <em>(-30%, 15% of portfolio)</em></h5>
<p>I bought all the way down from $240 to $125. I still have a pretty high conviction, let’s see how it plays out! I see this as my first true test as a value investor.</p>

<p>Don’t clone blindly.
Identify what changes the fundamental and what is just noise.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h5 id="clover-health--61-6-of-portfolio">Clover Health <em>(-61%, 6% of portfolio)</em></h5>
<p>A stock that r/wallstreetbets was speculating for a short squeeze, or a gamma squeeze, whatever it is. It crashed when the management announced a new share offering at a really low price without an explanation, which is a huge red flag. I still believe the company has a good growth prospect but I certainly bought in too early.</p>

<p>NO MORE FOMO!
Buy only profitable companies.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="closed-positions">Closed Positions</h3>

<p><br /></p>

<h5 id="revenue-40">Revenue <em>(+40%)</em></h5>
<p>I bought when the stock had a P/E ratio of 70, which is in hindsight too high considering the growth shown by the company. At one point I was up almost 100% but it didn’t make an impact because I bought too little. The CEO said a lot about making an ecosystem, digital banking, overseas expansion, etc but no real progress so far (might be because of Covid-19). I sold the stock because I was holding too little of it, might be buying back if it drops to its fair value.</p>

<p>Beware of management that gives too many promises.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h5 id="arbb-4">ARBB <em>(+4%)</em></h5>
<p>The company is in a growing industry with a P/E ratio of only 3. Sold after the Serba Dinamik saga as the company has the exact same problem - high receivables.</p>

<p>Sometimes a company has a low valuation for a reason.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h5 id="hong-seng--2">Hong Seng <em>(-2%)</em></h5>
<p>After seeing the news about the company’s plan to manufacture gloves, I bought the stock in anticipation of the stock going up like other glove stocks, without doing any further research. I sold off when the price didn’t go anywhere after a few months. However, the stock had 7x at its peak in 2021.</p>

<p>You can’t hold a stock without strong conviction.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h5 id="teledoc--2">Teledoc <em>(-2%)</em></h5>
<p>Followed Cathie Wood who kept buying the dip, without doing proper valuation. The price dropped another 35% after I sold.</p>

<p>Buy after a company had proved their business model.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h5 id="bursa-malaysia--12">Bursa Malaysia <em>(-12%)</em></h5>
<p>I bought it because I expected the daily trading value to be around 3B which is higher than pre-pandemic. Sold when the market cooled off quickly (ADV of ~2B) after the announcement of increased trading cost.</p>

<p>Always have a margin of safety.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h5 id="cypark--24">Cypark <em>(-24%)</em></h5>
<p>High debt company. Sold after it announced private placement.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h5 id="vivocom--45">Vivocom <em>(-45%)</em></h5>
<p>My first huge loss in the stock market. Blindly trusting the confidence of a Facebook page Mr Bursa, and hoping to get some quick profit, I bought right at the top and kept buying the ‘dip’. I didn’t even know what the company does. The stock has down another 60% after I sold.</p>

<p>There is no easy money.
If something is too good to be true, it’s not.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h5 id="kpower--51">Kpower <em>(-51%)</em></h5>
<p>The company seemed to be transitioning into great industries, namely renewable energy and logistic. However, it crashed along with Serba Dinamik as they share the same director. I bought the dip after making the judgement that it has independent management and no real connection with Serba Dinamik, which turned out to be a bad decision. It has dropped another 40% after I sold my last positions.</p>

<p>Never buy a company just because of a high profile CEO</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h5 id="serba-dinamik--52">Serba Dinamik <em>(-52%)</em></h5>
<p>This is definitely my biggest lesson in 2021. Even though I was a self-proclaimed value investor since the beginning, the unfortunate case of Serba Dinamik was what got me into digging into a company’s financials and doing serious valuation.</p>

<p>When I was getting started in the stock market, I thought I found a gem that was trading at a low P/E ratio with high growth. However, the EPS actually didn’t increase much as they kept issuing new shares over the years through private placement. I felt strange when the company kept venturing into new businesses (e-commerce, IT, space exploration) but failed to do anything about it.</p>

<p>Sold after the company got exposed for accounting fraud, where it’s suspected that some of the receivables were made up, and the stock price suffered limit down (30% decline) for 2 days straight. Glad I made the right call by selling at a huge loss, the stock is now suspended from trading.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Beware of dilution.</li>
  <li>No company should raise funds to give dividends.</li>
  <li>Avoid companies with high receivables.</li>
  <li>Free cash flow is the money made, not net earnings. In a good company, the two should align.</li>
  <li>Diworsification is a real thing.</li>
  <li>Sell company that involves in an accounting scandal immediately. You can always buy back when the issue is resolved.</li>
</ul>

				<![CDATA[	
 				<h3>My Investment Plan</h3>
    		<p>1 min.</p>
				<div><p><img src="../assets/image/blog/2022bad.jpg" alt="2021 is finally over!" title="2022 is coming!" /></p>

<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="individual-stocks-50">Individual Stocks (50%)</h3>

<p>Sell stocks that I don’t have strong enough conviction.
Continue finding great businesses that I understand.
Do valuation and wait.
Buy in batches when the price falls in my fair value range.</p>

<p>Some great companies that are not too far off from my valuation:</p>

<p>Alphabet ($GOOG), Meta Platforms ($FB), Taiwan Semiconductor ($TSM), Disney ($DIS), Xiaomi (HKG:1810)</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="etf----25">ETF    (25%)</h3>

<h5 id="cspx">$CSPX</h5>

<p>A much smaller S&amp;P500 index-tracking ETF compared to $SPY and $VOO. However, it is more attractive to foreigners with lower dividend withholding tax, and is easier to manage because the dividend is automatically reinvested. I would love to have it as a benchmark to see if I can do better with picking individual stocks after learning for more than a year in the market.</p>

<p>Buy every quarter.
Don’t try to time the market.</p>

<h5 id="smh">$SMH</h5>

<p>One of the best-performing holdings I had in 2021 because of the boom of the semiconductor industry. I am still bullish in the sector but some of the companies are just way too overvalued. A good way to hold great monopolies like $TSM, $ASML, $NVDA and more.</p>

<h5 id="ipay">$IPAY</h5>

<p>Another industry that I am optimistic about - mobile/cashless payment. Bought some during the selloff in 2021. $V, $MA, $PYPL, $SQ are all companies I am interested in but there is just too much competition to be sure which company will come on top. The improvement of the technology of cryptocurrencies especially lightning network might disrupt the whole industry too.</p>

<h5 id="kweb">$KWEB</h5>

<p>China internet sector ETF which had dropped more than 50% from its peak. Wouldn’t mind buying more due to the cheap valuation but beware not to overexpose to Chinese stocks. I plan to keep the Chinese part of my portfolio under 30%.</p>

<h5 id="meta">$META</h5>

<p>I might buy this for exposure to metaverse concept companies like $NVDA, $U, $RBLX. However, these companies have just too crazy valuations to justify buying.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="cryptocurrencies--15">Cryptocurrencies  (15%)</h3>

<h5 id="btc-eth">BTC, ETH</h5>
<p>Buy more if the market crashes.
HODL if the bull market continues.
Keep my exposure to below 15%.</p>

<h5 id="whiteboardcrypto-club">WhiteBoardCrypto Club</h5>

<p>Learn more about DeFi and blockchain.
Don’t waste the $29 per month.
Be cautious with NFT.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="cash----10">Cash    (10%)</h3>
<p>Have at least 10% cash in my brokerage accounts at all times.
Put in more money after I settle everything in university.</p>

			<title>Serba Dinamik: The Hindsight</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[	
 				
    		<p>4 min.</p>
				<div><p>Earlier this year, Serba Dinamik’s auditor KPMG had raised issues regarding the company’s sales transactions, trade receivables and payables, as well as material on-site balances. The issues raised involved 11 parties which accounted for total sales transactions of RM2.32 billion, trade receivables balance of RM652 million and materials on site balance of RM569 million. Since then, the share price of the company had dropped all the way down from RM1.6 to RM0.35 and has been suspended from trading since October 22.</p>

<p>However, that didn’t free Serba Dinamik from further troubles such as preventing the release of a special independent review (SIR), failing to release their annual report, endless changes in the board room, and missing coupon payments, just to name a few. Currently, they are seeking legal recourse against Bursa Malaysia, EY and its original auditors KPMG.</p>

<p>Even though I’m definitely sceptical about Serba Dinamik’s innocence, I’m not here to judge who’s right and wrong, since the damage to all the retail investors’ wealth had already been done (including 52% of my invested capital). Instead, I’m trying to learn from my mistake of investing in Serba Dinamik by studying their annual reports from 2013 to 2021.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="the-big-6">The Big 6</h3>
<p>Let’s start by analyzing the 6 most important things to identify a great business, credit to Rule #1 by Phil Town. (It’s originally The Big 5, but I modified it a bit.)</p>

<div class="w3-container" style="padding:0px 0px 10px">
    <img title="The Big 6" class="w3-image w3-padding" width="400" max-width="400" src="../assets/image/blog/serbadk/big6.png" alt="The Big 6" />
</div>

<p>At first sight, this seems like a rare gem that almost checks all the boxes. Some of the companies that I found so many greens are monopolies like $GOOG, $FB and $MSFT. However, a closer look will prove otherwise. For one, the seemingly high free cash flow growth is actually growing over 50% in the negative direction. In hindsight, below are all the issues that I could’ve found in their financial statements, without looking into their allegedly questionable business practices, but just the numbers.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="dilution">Dilution</h3>

<div class="w3-container" style="padding:0px 0px 10px">
    <img title="Dilution" class="w3-image w3-padding" width="400" max-width="400" src="../assets/image/blog/serbadk/graph1.png" alt="Dilution" />
</div>

<p>5-year net income CAGR:    25.6%</p>

<p>5-year earnings per share CAGR:    16.5%</p>

<p>Even though the company had a really impressive net income 5-year CAGR of over 30%, its EPS growth rates were almost always lower than its net income growth rate, and in some years was just half of that of its earnings. Don’t get me wrong, 16% CAGR is in no way weak growth, but this should be the first red flag that the company is diluting its shareholders since the earnings had to be divided into more and more shares.</p>

<p>From the income statements, they actually grew the shares outstanding from 2.7 billion in 2017 to 3.7 billion in 2021, with a CAGR of 7.8%. This is actually not that bad, considering high-growth companies usually need more cash to fund their operations. For comparison, $TSLA diluted their shareholders by 10.7% annually from 2017 to 2020.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="receivables">Receivables</h3>

<p>Receivables are debts owed to a company by its customers for goods or services that have been delivered or used but not yet paid for. Receivables are recorded as revenue at the time of a sale when a good or service has been delivered but not yet been paid for.</p>

<div class="w3-container" style="padding:0px 0px 10px">
    <img title="Receivables" class="w3-image w3-padding" width="400" max-width="400" src="../assets/image/blog/serbadk/graph2.png" alt="Receivables" />
</div>

<p>In the case of Serba Dinamik, their receivables were growing strongly along with their revenue and earnings, and in recent years, the receivables generated in a single year were even higher than the net income of the year. If they failed to collect the payments from their customers, it would risk wiping out all the net income.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="free-cash-flow">Free Cash Flow</h3>

<div class="w3-container" style="padding:0px 0px 10px">
    <img title="Free Cash Flow" class="w3-image w3-padding" width="400" max-width="400" src="../assets/image/blog/serbadk/graph3.png" alt="Free Cash Flow" />
</div>

<p>Free cash flow is the real profit generated for the owners, while net income is just the money made on the income statement. Therefore, it is said that buying a company is buying the future cash flow of the company. In a good company, free cash flow and net income generated should be heading in the same direction in the long run, even though there might be some one-time events that hurt the free cash flow. For Serba Dinamik, the two were both growing consistently, in a completely different directions. By running a company like this, you can achieve good growth on the earnings reports but will never see the money coming into your pocket (unless you are a genius and do the following trick).</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="fund-raising">Fund Raising</h3>

<div class="w3-container" style="padding:0px 0px 10px">
    <img title="Fund Raising" class="w3-image w3-padding" width="400" max-width="400" src="../assets/image/blog/serbadk/graph4.png" alt="Fund Raising" />
</div>

<p>From 2017 to 2021, the company raised around RM2.2 billion from its investors by issuing new shares. However, the company had also been increasing the dividends paid to their shareholders, at a stunning rate of 35%. For a company that failed to generate free cash flow every year, they sure were generous with their dividends. This essentially means that they were getting cash from their investors, just to give a part out as dividends. In the end, the management was the people who benefited from the multiple fund-raisings by pocketing their huge sum of dividends.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>金玉其外，败絮其中 is a Chinese idiom which means something that is looking good on the outside but is a mess on the inside.</p>

<p>The top-line and bottom-line growth alone can’t give the full picture of how well a company is doing, but what is on the headline is always revenue and income. Always look for red flags in a company’s financial statements. Don’t be a sheep.</p>

			<title>One Up on Wall Street</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[	
 				
    		<p>4 min.</p>
				<div><p>I have been pushing myself to once again pick up the habit of reading in 2021. The last time I read seriously I was 15 (now 22). So far I have finished 11 books (not a lot but at least a good start) and One Up on Wall Street is one of them. Even though I have only read a few books about investing, this book by Peter Lynch is definitely the easiest to understand and no doubt my favourite. I will keep coming back to this article to keep myself on track when I feel uncertain about my investment. Hopefully, I will become a better and better investor.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4 id="personal-qualities">Personal Qualities</h4>
<p>The qualities required to be a successful investor are patience, self-reliance, common sense, a tolerance for pain, open-mindedness, detachment, persistence, humility, flexibility, a willingness to do independent research, an equal willingness to admit to mistakes, and the ability to ignore general panic. It is also crucial to be able to resist human nature and your gut feeling.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4 id="reminder">Reminder</h4>

<p>Just because the price goes up doesn’t mean you’re right.</p>

<p>Just because the price goes down doesn’t mean you’re wrong.</p>

<p>Sometime in the next month, year, or three years, the market will decline sharply.</p>

<p>Market declines are great opportunities to buy stocks in companies you like.</p>

<p>Unless you’re confident enough in the company to buy more shares in a dip or crash, sell immediately.
When in doubt, tune in later.</p>

<p>You don’t have own every good company.</p>

<p>You don’t lose anything by not owning a successful stock, even if it’s a ten-bagger.</p>

<p>There is no next Home Depot, no next Amazon, no next Costco.</p>

<p>To come out ahead you don’t have to be right all the time, or even a majority of the time.</p>

<p>Buying a company with mediocre prospects just because the stock is cheap is a losing technique.</p>

<p>Selling an outstanding fast grower because its stock seems slightly overpriced is a losing technique.</p>

<p>Don’t become so attached to a winner that complacency sets in and you stop monitoring the story.</p>

<p>You won’t improve results by pulling out the flowers and watering the weeds.</p>

<p>Don’t try time things that are beyond your control, i.e. interest rate, stock prices in the short term, monetary policy, recession, etc.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4 id="checklist">Checklist</h4>

<p>Consider the size of a company if you expect it to profit from a specific product.</p>

<p>It’s better to miss the first move in a stock and wait to see if a company’s plans are working out.</p>

<p>Look for small companies that are already profitable and have proven that their concept is duplicatable in different markets.</p>

<p>Moderately fast growers (20~25%) in nongrowth industries are ideal investments.</p>

<p>Invest in simple companies that appear dull, mundane, out of favour, and haven’t caught the fancy of Wall Street.</p>

<p>Companies that have no debt can’t go bankrupt.</p>

<p>Base your purchases on the company’s prospects, not on the president’s resume or speaking ability.</p>

<p>Avoid hot stocks in hot industries.</p>

<p>If the stock is grossly overpriced, even if everything else goes right, you won’t make any money.</p>

<p>Find a storyline to follow as a way of monitoring a company’s progress.</p>

<p>Look for companies with little or no institutional ownership.</p>

<p>All else being equal, favour companies in which management has a significant personal investment over companies run by people that benefit only from their salaries.</p>

<p>Beware the stocks with exiting names.</p>

<p>Buy a business that can be run by any idiot.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4 id="the-six-categories-of-stocks">The Six Categories of Stocks</h4>

<h6 id="1-the-slow-growers--focus-on-dividend-and-payout-ratio">1. THE SLOW GROWERS — focus on dividend and payout ratio</h6>

<p>Large and aging companies are the slower grower but slightly faster than the gross national product. Sooner or later every popular fast-growing industry becomes slow growing.</p>

<h6 id="2-the-stalwarts--focus-on-pe-ratio-and-factors-to-accelerate-growth-rate">2. THE STALWARTS — focus on P/E ratio and factors to accelerate growth rate</h6>

<p>These are multi-billion companies that are expected to grow faster than slow growers (10~12% annual growth). Companies in this category offer good protection during recessions and hard times. For example, people will continue to eat cornflakes during recession and thus Kellogg will grow steadily.</p>

<h6 id="3-the-fast-growers---focus-on-where-and-how-it-plans-to-continue-to-grow-fast">3. THE FAST GROWERS  — focus on where and how it plans to continue to grow fast</h6>

<p>These are small, aggressive new enterprises that grow at 20~25% a year. With a small portfolio, one or two of these can make a career. A fast growing company doesn’t necessarily have to be in the fast-growing industry. Risk in fast growers is overzealous and underfinanced young companies.</p>

<h6 id="4-the-cyclicals--focus-on-business-conditions-inventories-and-prices">4. THE CYCLICALS — focus on business conditions, inventories and prices</h6>

<p>In a cyclical industry, companies’ sales and profits are expanding and contracting regularly. The autos and the airlines, the tire companies, steel companies, and chemical companies are all cyclicals. When bought at the wrong part of the economic cycle, it may be years before you’ll see another upswing.</p>

<h6 id="5-turnarounds--focus-on-the-companys-plan">5. TURNAROUNDS — focus on the company’s plan</h6>

<p>Turnaround candidates have been battered, depressed and go so far down in a down cycle that people think it would never come back again. The majority of turnarounds fail, but the occasional major success makes the turnaround business very exciting, and very rewarding overall.</p>

<h6 id="6-the-asset-plays--focus-on-assets-and-how-much-they-are-worth">6. THE ASSET PLAYS — focus on assets and how much they are worth</h6>

<p>An asset play is any company that is sitting on something valuable that you have known about, but the crown has overlooked. You are looking for a business with assets whether it’s cash, investments, properties, machines, etc that is worth more than the price you will pay for the stock.</p>

			<title>Being Multilingual</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[	
 				
    		<p>5 min.</p>
				<div><p>This comes from the perspective of a person (me) who can technically (it’s complicated, trust me) speak 5 languages. Here’s a little about me:</p>

<ul>
  <li>My mother tongue is Chinese.</li>
  <li>I have had 13 years of formal education in Chinese, English and Malay.</li>
  <li>I learnt to speak Cantonese through Hong Kong movies and dramas.</li>
  <li>My family speaks Hakka, which I can understand but can’t speak.</li>
  <li>I’m currently studying mechanical engineering in Japanese.</li>
  <li>I just started learning German in Japanese.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here are some of the advantages, struggles and thoughts I found about being multilingual. I’m not sure about all those “increased career opportunities” claims though, but I wish I could get a five-fold salary.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3 id="learning-a-new-language-is-easy">Learning a new language is easy</h3>

<p>Let’s start off with a common one! Coming from someone who knows Chinese, arguably one of the hardest languages to learn, I find learning Japanese really not that hard.</p>

<p>Having 10+ years of experience writing Chinese characters undoubtedly gave me a huge head start in learning Japanese, so I really can’t brag about how easy Japanese is. However, being able to speak Cantonese just by watching TV might be a prove of this point.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3 id="open-for-more-information">Open for more information</h3>

<p>Multilingual means I can do multilingual searches on Google.</p>

<p>When you are doing research or studying, knowing more languages won’t hurt. You can find way more tutorials and papers online in English than say, Japanese. When I have a hard time understanding a topic in Japanese, I always try googling it in Chinese and English, which most of the time gives me a better understanding. Okay, maybe because my Japanese sucks.</p>

<p>Knowing less language really limits the information you can obtain from the world, the internet especially.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="getting-a-bigger-picture">Getting a bigger picture</h3>

<p>We all have been click-baited by a news site before. Even if it’s about the same topic, journalists of different news sources will try to come up with titles and articles that are more likely to be clicked on and shared by their targeted readers.</p>

<p>In Malaysia, people of different races generally have very different cultures, religions, political views, and often, they speak different languages and consume only media of their own language. Because of that, so-called “news sites” will always filter or tweak the news to fit with what their readers want to see, religiously or politically, to a point where the bias is obvious.</p>

<p>It’s certainly wiser to get your daily news from different sources, even better if you read them in different languages, to get a bigger picture of what really happened.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="making-friends-through-translation">Making friends through translation</h3>

<p>You can make friends pretty naturally by being the translation guy, more effective than any conversation starter because they’ll have no choice but to talk to you. (not joking)</p>

<p>There are activities in my school which students from different countries will be joining. Korean who speaks Korean and Japanese, Taiwanese who speaks Chinese and a bit of English, Singaporean who speaks English, as well as Japanese who speaks only Japanese, but there was me, who can understand and connect them all!</p>

<p>Not just through translation, knowing extra languages can help make more friends from all over the world!</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="always-having-a-backup-language">Always having a backup language</h3>

<p>We all have moments where we need to talk to our friend without a third person understanding, mainly out of politeness (because what we’re about to say might not be polite enough, like talking shit). With a few languages in my pocket, I’m able to pull out the right language at the right time.</p>

<p>I can ask my Chinese friend, “几点要回？走咯走咯。” in a never-ending Hari Raya open house.
I can tell my Malay friend, “Tak nak lah, mahal ni,” in an overpriced Japanese outlet.
I can tell my spy friend, “- -    - — - -    — - —” over a bugged phone call.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="speaking-in-only-one-language-is-hard">Speaking in only one language is hard</h3>

<p>I’m well aware of how messed up my languages are. My Chinese is mixed with Cantonese and English, and I can’t speak English without some sort of Chinese slang.</p>

<p>I’ve always had to flick the “Use only one language” switch on when I’m talking to people that only speak one language, like Taiwanese, American and Japanese. I’ll always have to think twice in my head whether they can understand a certain phrase I use, and try to find a “real” word as a replacement. That’s a struggle for me being multilingual but of course a very good training indeed.</p>

<p>I love my Singaporean friends who have similar backgrounds, which means we can speak Chinglish/Manglish/Singlish together, hooray!</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="keyboard-sucks">Keyboard sucks</h3>

<p>As a person who has to text in multiple languages, I have to tap the little globe icon on my phone keyboard to switch between inputs, namely English, Chinese, Japanese, and a handwriting keyboard whenever I can’t read a kanji.</p>

<p>It’s especially annoying when I accidentally missed the language I want to use next and had to tap another three times to switch it back, only to realize that I tapped too fast and missed it again. And repeat.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h2 id="multilingual-faqs"><strong>Multilingual FAQs</strong></h2>

<h3 id="1-you-can-speak-so-many-languages-are-you-a-genius">1. You can speak so many languages, are you a genius?</h3>

<p>Seriously, I did not make this question up. I get this sometimes from my Japanese classmates, who are surprised to learn that I know so many languages.</p>

<p>No, I’m really not a genius. I know dozens of people personally who are like me. If you were born in Malaysia, being bilingual or multilingual is really common, I’m just lucky to have the chance to learn additional Japanese.</p>

<h3 id="2-what-language-do-you-think-in">2. What language do you think in?</h3>

<p>I’d say that I can think in the language I’m speaking most of the time, without needing to do translation in my head. If I’m just thinking random stuff without talking out loud, it’s primarily in Chinese, but with sprinkles of English words like how I normally speak. However, I realized that I process math in English no matter the language I’m learning math with.</p>

<h3 id="3-which-language-is-the-easiesthardest">3. Which language is the easiest/hardest?</h3>

<p>To be honest, I really have no idea. Mainly because it’s been so long since I started learning most of the languages I know. It’s said that children can learn a language much easier than an average adult, so I guess all of them were pretty easy for 5-year-old me to learn.</p>

<p>If I have to pick one as the hardest, I’d probably say Japanese because that’s the only language I still remember the learning process. Anyway, I remember I struggled a lot in English spelling in kindergarten. Poem and classical Chinese in high school were difficult too.</p>

<h3 id="4-can-you-say-something-in-language">4. CaN yOu SaY sOmEtHiNg In (language)?</h3>

<p>Yes, thank you for requesting. No, I only do paid performance. How about saying something in Python? I know a saying that goes</p>

<p>print(“stfu”)</p>

<p>Peace.</p>

			<title>Should I Get a Part-time Job in Japan?</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[	
 				
    		<p>4 min.</p>
				<div><p>One of the most surprising things I encountered in Japan is the percentage of students having a part-time job. Among my 46 classmates, I can confidently say that at least 30 of them are working after school, mostly at a restaurant or a convenience store. The number might even be higher because I don’t really know every one of them.</p>

<p>Some of the seniors from Malaysia in my area work as a tutor at a tuition centre, teaching middle school students science and maths. Working as a cashier or a waiter in Japan usually earn 900 yen per hour, while a tutor can earn much more.</p>

<p>Back in my high school life (in Malaysia), there was pretty much no one in my class that worked part-time after school. There were just too many tuition classes to attend and too many expectations to not disappoint. The low pay might also be one of the reasons I think.</p>

<p>I’m always curious about the reasons for working while studying. In fact, some of my classmates couldn’t balance earning and studying, forcing them to retake several papers, or in a worse case, putting themselves on the verge of repeating the same class for another year. In my opinion, student studies, and education should always be the priority.</p>

<p>Of course, there are people who have to pay for their own bills, or have to work to support their family, even if they are still an 18-year-old student. Everyone has their own circumstances. Not everyone is lucky like me.</p>

<p>However, from what I see, most of them just wanted to save money to buy things they like, most of the time really expensive things. High-end game consoles, phones, clothes, shoes, fishing reels (yes, the guy on my right spent ¥20,000 on one), you name it. Buying things you like with your hard-earned money is not necessarily a bad thing, but I don’t see the necessity.</p>

<p>One of my friends spent ¥52465 for a pair of Eytys Halo Suede Off White, size 41. Woah, how did I know all the details? He couldn’t read the English website so I translated every word for him (except for the T&amp;C). He worked almost 60 hours for the shoes, which is really beyond my imagination. An 18-year-old me wouldn’t even spend more than RM40 for a t-shirt and it still hurts if I do it now.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h2 id="what-can-i-get-from-working-part-time">What can I get from working part-time?</h2>

<p>As a scholar who is being paid to study and has allowance enough to travel multiple times a year, do I really need to work? That’s the question I asked myself a lot last year.</p>

<p>Like any other job, it comes down to just two things: Money and experience.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="do-i-need-the-money">Do I need the money?</h3>

<p>Who doesn’t like having more money, right? If you think about it, working part-time in Japan can even make more money than a newly graduated engineer in Malaysia. A foreign student in Japan can work up to 28 hours a week, which can earn around ¥100,000 (~RM4,000) every month, more than the salary of a fresh graduate in Malaysia (RM3,000-RM4,000).</p>

<p>I’m really privileged to not have any problems financially, all thanks to the sponsor of this post, JPA. That means every cent I ever made from a part-time job will go straight into my saving.</p>

<p>If I could save more in Japan, my life would be so much easier when I’m back in Malaysia. I could’ve started saving money to buy a house or start a business now, earlier than all of my peers.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="do-i-need-the-experience">Do I need the experience?</h3>

<p>Through doing a part-time job, I can get more chances to communicate with Japanese in a polite and (overly) formal way. It must be worth my time and energy if I get to work in Japan after getting my degree.</p>

<p>But that’s not the case for me. I have to work for the Malaysian government in order to not be in debt right after graduating.</p>

<p>If I were to work part-time, I would surely choose a job that could be useful for my endeavour to become an engineer. At least I don’t see how working as a cashier help.</p>

<p>Of course working as a tutor is a great experience, no matter what my job will be in the future. I am teaching English in my school once or twice in a month too! Even though I suck at teaching!</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h2 id="so-should-i-get-a-part-time-job">So, should I get a part-time job?</h2>

<p>Maybe I should, but I won’t, at least for now. It’s no doubt that I have the free time to work and I don’t mind having extra cash in my pocket. But I feel like I have better things to do.</p>

<p>I’m still searching for what I really like, and what kind of profession suits me best. Since last year, I’ve been taking courses online, learning about machine learning, web development, CAD modelling and more to come. There I discovered and developed a great interest and passion in coding, and I would love to dive deeper in the world of colourful texts. And yes, I started writing too!</p>

<p>I wouldn’t be able to do all these if I started working part-time.</p>

<p>Is learning new stuff on the internet worth more than ¥1000 per hour? I don’t know, but I guess I will continue doing what I like for now, when I still have the time to do so.</p>

<p>That’s my two cents on getting a part-time job as a student. My view might change later and I will update this post when it does.</p>

<p>Peace.</p>
