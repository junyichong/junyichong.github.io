The Investment Portfolio Tracker is a powerful spreadsheet tool I developed to streamline and simplify investment portfolio management. This versatile tool allows users to track their investments, monitor portfolio performance, and seamlessly share the tracker with other individuals or teams.

##### Key Features:

1. Comprehensive Portfolio Tracking:
   The tracker provides a comprehensive overview of investments, allowing users to organize and track various assets, such as stocks, bonds, ETFs, or cryptocurrencies. It enables users to record important details like the purchase date, quantity, cost, fees, and any additional notes. Users can also track the cash flow in the portfolio through cash deposit and withdrawal. 

2. Real-Time Data Updates:
   Leveraging the power of live data feeds using Google Finance and integration with financial APIs, the tracker fetches and updates asset prices automatically, ensuring real-time valuation of the portfolio. This feature provides users with up-to-date insights into their investments' performance and overall portfolio value.

3. Performance Analysis:
   The tracker incorporates built-in calculations and visualizations to analyze portfolio performance. It generates reports, charts, and graphs that illustrate asset allocation, historical returns, and performance metrics. These tools aid users in assessing the strengths and weaknesses of their investment strategy.

4. Collaborative Sharing:
   A feature of this portfolio tracker is its ability to be shared with other individuals or teams. Users can grant access to colleagues, partners, or financial advisors, enabling them to view and collaborate on the portfolio in real-time. This fosters efficient communication, collaboration, and joint decision-making regarding investment strategies.

5. Customization and Flexibility:
   The spreadsheet-based design allows users to customize the tracker to suit their specific needs. They can add or remove columns, create additional sheets, or incorporate formulas and macros to automate calculations or perform advanced analysis.
